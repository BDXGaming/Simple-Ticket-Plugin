# Simple-Ticket-Plugin

## Purpose
This plugin is designed to take the complexity out of Minecraft in-game ticketing! With this plugin all you have to do is drop it into the plugins folder and configure the three permission nodes. The goal of the plugin was to avoid the clutter and the complexity of other ticketing solutions. Rather this plugin takes out the complexity only having a few simple and easy to use commands!

## Setup
To setup this plugin download the .jar from the spigot page. Put this plugin into the plugins folder for your spigot server. When the plugin is loaded for the first time a folder and config file will be created. Within the config file is the initial message that is sent when a player opens a ticket, you can change this to whatever you like!

## Commands
There are only 4 commands within the entire plugin. Below are the commands and what they do. As usual there is tab complete on the command with args. 
- /ticket (claim, close, delete) (ticket number) : aliases (tr)
- /newticket : aliases (nt, ntick)
- /treload aliases (ticketreload)
- /tickets : aliases (listtickets)

## Compatability
This plugin uses the displayname of the user, so it works with both rank prefixes and with colored nicknames. This means that any staff/moderators that may use this plugin could keep their displaynamees so players could be certain that they are speaking with staff.
